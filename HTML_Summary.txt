HTML Summary
- List of HTML tags: self closing and "containing"
- See https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp

br, !--
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, & h6
p, a, b or strong, i or em
sub, sup
ul, ol; both with li

<ol type="1|a|A|i|I"> <!Different numbering styles>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc|circle|square|none"></ul> <!--Intro to CSS-->

href= “URL”, “File.Extension”, “#ID”, target=“_blank”
<!-- Absolute and Relative Links -->
“#ID” could be the top of a page, this is degraded in HTML5
Example JavaScript: 
<a href="javascript:alert('Hello World!');">Execute JavaScript</a>

hreflang
download

img, scr="URL", alt="URL" , title="", style="width:375px;height=211px;", “File.Extension"
Note: in HTML img is self closing, XHTML must have closing tag
Inline formatting
srcset: defines multiple sizes of the same image allowing browser to select 
	the most appropriate size
height & width: identifies height and width of an image in CSS pixels
usemap: specifies a client-side image to be used with the image
ismap: defines server-side image map, needs mouse coordinates too
longdesc: defines a URL where more information can be found by the image 
(does this work?)
